* 54 How To Get Help with GNU Emacs

If you need help installing, using or changing GNU Emacs, there are two ways to find it:

- Send a message to [the help-gnu-emacs mailing list](https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/help-gnu-emacs), or post your request on newsgroup `gnu.emacs.help`.  (This mailing list and newsgroup interconnect, so it does not matter which one you use.)
- Look in the [service directory](https://www.fsf.org/resources/service/) for someone who might help you for a fee.
